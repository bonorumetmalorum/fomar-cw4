parameters chosen for lights are based on best look and feel
these can be changed for better visibility

question c)
light{colour(0, 255, 129), lightLocation, (diffuseIntensity) 0.01, (specularIntensity) 0.1, () 100.0, 0.1}
Material{colour(125, 125, 125), 0.1, 0.1, 0.01}

creates a green look for the triangle by blending the colours of the light and triangle.
specular highlight is very sharp for visibility
other values are toned down due to sensitivity and proximity of light
